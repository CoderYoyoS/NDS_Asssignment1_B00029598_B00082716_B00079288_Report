# Conclusions and Further Work

## Further Work
While the implementation of this chat application was successful, a more appropriate way to implement this program would be to allow users to communicate over different hosts. However this was outside the scope of the project. Moreover, additional features can be equipped to enhance the users experience and the overall application. A database that can store, update and interact with data can be integrated to facilitate a number of other features. For example allowing users to create and updated their own individual accounts, upload profile pictures and see their chat history. An interface can be developed to allow a user to sign up for or into their pre-existing account. Furthermore other features such as allowing the user to send pictures, sounds and other files over the chat application can be incorporated to add another layer of depth and usability.


## Conclusion
This project looked at implementing a multi â€“ client chat application using Sockets and the TCP networking protocol in Java. It was successful in incorporating these technologies within this application to complete the overall project. Furthermore, this document clearly demonstrated and outline the project requirements, the consideration of different networking protocols during the design process and the decision made to use TCP. Moreover, it discussed the steps taken in order to implement the TCP protocol into this project and how it was achieved by providing detailed code snippets. A simple server GUI was designed and created to document and log events such as when a user log on and off, who said what and to record how many users where using the application. Moreover, a simple and easy to use client GUI was created to allow a user to sign in anonymously or with a custom user name. To allow a user to send and receive messages, see who is user the application and finally allow a user to log off.
