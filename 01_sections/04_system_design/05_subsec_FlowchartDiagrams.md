## Client Use Case


The following use case diagram explains the usual interaction a user may have with the software. Initially the program is ran by starting the server and the client and then establishing a connection. The user may choose to enter their own username that will be seen by the other clients or they may choose an anonymous username, which is assigned to them by the program. Upon successful login, the user is then enabled to interact with other clients that are connected. Messages can be sent by the user to other clients until the user has decided to disconnect. Following the disconnection from the server, the user is logged out and their client window is closed.
