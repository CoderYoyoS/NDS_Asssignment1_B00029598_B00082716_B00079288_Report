## GUI Design Client
In the design process of the client GUI specific attention was paid to creating a simple and easy to use interface. To achieve this a simplistic single page interface was implemented to simplify and limit the userâ€™s interaction with the UI. Moreover, this interface was designed to be simplistic in the way it refreshed and updated the interface. This was achieved by merely refreshing certain fields with updated values. Incorporating this simple design model led to a simplistic implementation for the client interface and more emphasis could be placed on the back-end server and client logic. Please see figure 3.1 below to see a simple design mock-up.
