## GUI Design Server
When designing the UI for the server, there was a focus put on mirroring the layout and structure of the client design as mentioned previously. In addition, the server interface was designed in a clear and concise manner in order for it to be easy, to not only keep track of who is using the application, but also to see each user that has entered into the chat group.
