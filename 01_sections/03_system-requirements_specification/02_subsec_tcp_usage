## TCP Protocol Using Java

In order to implement the TCP protocol server using Java code five steps are taken. Firstly, the server
is instantiated using ```ServerSocket``` and is bound to a specific port. 
```
         ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
```
Secondly, The server invokes the accept method and is constantly waiting until the
a client has made a connection on the given port. 
```
    while(true){
        Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();

        (...)
```
