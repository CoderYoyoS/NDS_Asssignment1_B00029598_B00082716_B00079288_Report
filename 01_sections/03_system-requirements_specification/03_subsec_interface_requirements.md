## User Interface Considerations

This section will outline what the required GUI's are, the tools chosen to develop them and other decisions made based upon the GUI specification. As per what is required in the specification, the client programs require a graphical user interface. The server GUI is optional but to accurately represent each action and transmission in the program, the server GUI will be a huge asset to demonstrating what is happening at each step of every message transmission, thus, implementation of the server interface was deemed necessary.
