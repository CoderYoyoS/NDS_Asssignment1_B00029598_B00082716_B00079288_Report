##TCP vs. UDP

The TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) protocol and the UDP(User Datagram Protocol) protocol both have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to making communications over a network. This section will explore both the TCP protocol and the UDP protocol to see what the benefits it serves to the proposed application. Finally, a decision will be made as to what protocol will suit the application best for implementation.  

TCP is a transport layer protocol in the OSI layer and is used to create a connection between remote clients("What Is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)? - Definition From Techopedia"). TCP is a connection oriented protocol and it has has several capabilities. TCP can guarantee that packets arrive at their intended destination and that all packets arrive in the same order in which they were sent. TCP also has flow control whereby two sockets can communicate with each other over a pipe that is individual to the two sockets. 

__(I'm not finished here going to add the UDP stuff and then finish off with the reason we chose TCP)__
