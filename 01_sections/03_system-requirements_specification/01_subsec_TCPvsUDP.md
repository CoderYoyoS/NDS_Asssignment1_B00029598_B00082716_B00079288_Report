##TCP vs. UDP

The TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) protocol and the UDP(User Datagram Protocol) protocol both have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to making communications over a network. This section will explore both the TCP protocol and the UDP protocol to see what the benefits it serves to the proposed application. Finally, a decision will be made as to what protocol will suit the application best for implementation.  

TCP is a transport layer protocol in the OSI layer and is used to create a connection between remote clients("What Is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)? - Definition From Techopedia").
