##TCP vs. UDP

The TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) protocol and the UDP(User Datagram Protocol) protocol both have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to making communications over a network.

Finally, a decision will be made as to what protocol will suit the application best for implementation.
