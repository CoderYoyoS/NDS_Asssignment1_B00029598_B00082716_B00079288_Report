# Introduction

The aims of this project is to develop a group chat application implemented with Java socket
programming. This program allows multiple clients to connect to server, send messages to other clients who are connected and will also 
provide a simple server interface for logging events that occur within the system. Additionally, The application will make use of clean graphical user interface
design to provide ease of use for each client. Furthermore, this report will cover a number of sections. Initially, the system requirements and specifications 
will be highlighted in order to explain the functional and non functional goals of the software. This is succeeded by a description of the system design and 
why the following design choices were implemented. An implementation section is also given as to explain the code written to
achieve a working application. Finally, a conclusion will be given on the achievements and further work of the project.
