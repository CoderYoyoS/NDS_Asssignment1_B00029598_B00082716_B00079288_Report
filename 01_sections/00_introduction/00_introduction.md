# Introduction

The aims of this project is to develop a group chat application implemented with Java scoket
programming. This program allows multiple clients to connect to server using client graphical user interfaces
and send messages to other clients who are also connected. Additionally, The application will make use of clean graphical 
user interface design to provide ease of use for each client and will also provide a server inerface
for logging events that occur within the system. Furthermore, this report will cover a number of sections. Initially, the
system requirements and specifications will be highlighted in order to explain the functional and non functional goals of the software. 
This is succeeded by a description of the system design and why the following design choice was implemented. An implementation
section is also given as to describe the code written to achieve a working application. Finally, a conclusion will be given on the
achievements and furtherwork of the project.
